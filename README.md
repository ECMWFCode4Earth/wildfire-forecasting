## Introduction

The Global ECMWF Fire Forecasting (GEFF) system, implemented in Fortran 90, is based on empirical models conceptualised several decades back. Recent GIS & Machine Learning advances could, theoretically, be used to boost these models' performance or completely replace the current forecasting system. However thorough benchmarking is needed to compare GEFF to Deep Learning based prediction techniques.

The project intends to reproduce the Fire Forecasting capabilities of GEFF using Deep Learning and develop further improvements in accuracy, geography and time scale through inclusion of additional variables or optimisation of model architecture & hyperparameters. Finally, a preliminary fire spread prediction tool is proposed to allow monitoring activities.

## TL; DR

This codebase (and this README) is a work-in-progress. The `master` is a stable release and we aim to address issues and introduce enhancements on a rolling basis. If you encounter a bug, please [file an issue](https://github.com/esowc/wildfire-forecasting/issues/new). Here are a quick few pointers that *just work* to get you going with the project:

* Clone & navigate into the repo and create a conda environment using `environment.yml` on Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04 only.
* All EDA and Inference notebooks must be run within this environment. Use `conda activate wildfire-dl`
* Check out the EDA notebooks titled [`EDA_X_mini_sample.ipynb`](data/EDA). We recommend `jupyterlab`.
* Check out the Inference notebooks for [`1 day, 10 day, 14 day and 21 day predictions`](examples/).
* The notebooks also include code to download a small sample  dataset.

**Next:**

* See [Getting Started](#getting-started) for how to set up your local environment for training or inference
* For a detailed description of the project codebase, check out the [Code_Structure_Overview](Code_Structure_Overview.md)
* Read the [Running Inference](#running-inference) section for testing pre-trained models on sample data.
* See [Implementation Overview](#implementation-overview) for details on tools & frameworks and how to retrain the model.

The work-in-progress documentation can be viewed online on [wildfire-forecasting.readthedocs.io](https://wildfire-forecasting.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Getting Started

### Using Binder

While we have included support for launching the repository in [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/esowc/wildfire-forecasting/master), the limited memory offered by Binder means that you might end up with crashed/dead kernels while trying to test the `Inference` or the `Forecast` notebooks. At this point, we don't have a workaround for this issue.

### Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/esowc/wildfire-forecasting.git
cd wildfire-forecasting
```

Once you have cloned and navigated into the repository, you can set up a development environment using either `conda` or `docker`. Refer to the relevant instructions below and then skip to the next section on [Running Inference](#running-inference)

### Using conda

To create the environment, run:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda clean -a
conda activate wildfire-dl
```

>The setup is tested on Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04 and Windows 10 only. On systems with CUDA supported GPU and CUDA drivers set up, the conda environment and the code ensure that GPUs are used by default for training and inference. If there isn't sufficient GPU memory, this will typically lead to Out of Memory Runtime Errors. As a rule of thumb, around 4 GiB GPU memory is needed for inference and around 12 GiB for training.

### Using Docker

We include a `Dockerfile` & `docker-compose.yml` and provide detailed instructions for setting up your development environment using Docker for training on both CPUs and GPUs. Please head over to the [Docker README](docker/README.md) for more details.

## Running Inference

* **Examples**:<br>
  The [Inference_2_1.ipynb](examples/Inference_2_1.ipynb), [Inference_4_10.ipynb](examples/Inference_4_10.ipynb), [Inference_4_14.ipynb](examples/Inference_4_14.ipynb), [Inference_7_21.ipynb](examples/Inference_7_21.ipynb) notebooks demonstrate the end-to-end procedure of loading data, creating model from saved checkpoint, and getting the predictions for 2 day input, 1 day output; and 4 day input, 10 day output, 4 day input, 14 day output and 7 day input, 21 day output experiments respectively.

* **Testing data**:<br>
  Ensure the access to fwi-forcings and fwi-reanalysis data. Limited sample data is available at `gs://deepgeff-data-v0` (Released for educational purposes only).

* **Pre-trained model**:<br>
  All previously trained models are listed in [pre-trained_models.md](src/model/checkpoints/pre-trained_models.md) with associated metadata. Select and download the desired pre-trained model checkpoint file via gsutil from `gs://deepgeff-models-v0`, set the `$CHECKPOINT_FILE`, `$FORCINGS_DIR` and `$REANALYSIS_DIR` directory paths through the flags while running testing or inference.

  * Example usage:
  `python src/test.py -in-days=2 -out-days=1 -forcings-dir=${FORCINGS_DIR} -reanalysis-dir=${REANALYSIS_DIR} -checkpoint-file='path/to/checkpoint'`

## Implementation overview

![deep-learning-network-architecture](./docs/source/_static/unet_tapered.svg)
We implement a modified U-Net style Deep Learning architecture using [PyTorch 1.6](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html). We use [PyTorch Lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning) for code organisation and reducing boilerplate. The mammoth size of the total original dataset (~1TB) means we use extensive GPU acceleration in the code using [NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit). For a GeForce RTX 2080 with 12GB memory and 40 vCPUs with 110 GB RAM, this translates to a 25x speedup over using only 8 vCPUs with 52GB RAM.

For reading geospatial datasets, we use [`xarray`](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/quick-overview.html) and [`netcdf4`](https://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/netCDF4/index.html). The [`imbalanced-learn`](https://imbalanced-learn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/under_sampling.html) library is useful for Undersampling to tackle the high data skew. Code-linting and formatting is done using [`black`](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [`flake8`](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/).

  - The entry point for training is [src/train.py](src/train.py). Input variables used for training the model, by default, as configured in the [master](https://github.com/esowc/wildfire-forecasting/tree/master) branch, are `Temperature`, `Precipitation`, `Windspeed` and `Relative Humidity`. Support for additional variables `Leaf Area Index`, `Volumetric Soil Water Level 1` and `Land Skin Temperature` and implemented in the respective [branches](https://github.com/esowc/wildfire-forecasting/branches):

    - For training with input variables `t2`, `tp`, `wspeed` and `rh` + additionally `lai`, switch to the [lai](https://github.com/esowc/wildfire-forecasting/tree/lai) branch. **Note:** You will additionally require require the data for precisely these 5 variables in the /data dir to perform the training/inference for this combination of inputs.

    - For training with input variables `t2`, `tp`, `wspeed` and `rh` + additionally `swvl1`, switch to the [swvl1](https://github.com/esowc/wildfire-forecasting/tree/swvl1) branch. **Note:** You will additionally require require the data for precisely these 5 variables in the /data dir to perform the training/inference for this combination of inputs.

    - For training with input variables `t2`, `tp`, `wspeed` and `rh` + additionally `skt`, switch to the [skt](https://github.com/esowc/wildfire-forecasting/tree/skt) branch. **Note:** You will additionally require require the data for precisely these 5 variables in the /data dir to perform the training/inference for this combination of inputs.

    - For training with input variables `t2`, `tp`, `wspeed` and `rh` + additionally `skt` as well as `swvl1`, switch to the [skt+swvl1](https://github.com/esowc/wildfire-forecasting/tree/skt+swvl1) branch. **Note:** You will additionally require the data for precisely these 6 variables in the `/data` dir to perform the training/inference for this combination of inputs.

      * **Example Usage**: `python src/train.py [-in-days 4] [-out-days 1] [-forcings-dir ${FORCINGS_DIR}] [-reanalysis-dir ${REANALYSIS_DIR}]`

  * **Dataset**: We train our model on 1 year of global data. The `gs://deepgeff-data-v0` dataset demonstrated in the various EDA and Inference notebooks are not intended for use with `src/train.py`. The scripts will fail if used with those small datasets. If you intend to re-run the training, reach out to us for access to a bigger dataset necessary for the scripts.

  * **Logging**: We use [Weights & Biases](https://www.wandb.com/) for logging our training. When running the training script, you can either provide a `wandb API key` or choose to skip logging altogether. W&B logging is free and lets you monitor your training remotely. You can sign up for an account and then use `wandb login` from inside the environment to supply the key.

  * **Visualizing Results**: Upon completion of training, the results summary json from `wandb` can be visualized in terms of Accuracy %, MSE % and MAE % using the plotting module.
    * **Example Usage**:
  `python src/plot.py -f <file> -i <in-days> -o <out-days>`

* The entry point for inference is [src/test.py](src/test.py). **Note:** When performing inference for a model trained with an additional variable in any of the branches, ensure access to the respective variables in the /data dir.
  * **Example Usage**: `python src/test.py [-in-days 4] [-out-days 1] [-forcings-dir ${FORCINGS_DIR}] [-reanalysis-dir ${REANALYSIS_DIR}] [-checkpoint-file ${CHECKPOINT_FILE}]`
